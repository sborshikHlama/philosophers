## My Philosophers Solution:
Deadlock prevention using direct prevention method, also knows as asymmetry. It breaks circular wait condition. I make even philosophers take right fork and odd philosophers to take left fork.

## Problem of asymmetry:
Asymmetry creates contention between philosophers and this contention is not fair, because one philosopher can eat more often then necessary and other can starve.
How to make dinner more fair: add thinking time so after philosopher ate, it should think a bit, so the one who was waiting for fork could eat.
